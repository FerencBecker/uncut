## Section 1: Product Overview

### Executive Summary

**Vágatlanul** is a dual-platform digital heritage application for the Néprajzi Múzeum (Hungarian Ethnography Museum) that brings historical photo studios and their work to life through interactive map-based exploration. The project delivers cultural heritage content through two complementary platforms: an offline exhibition kiosk and an online web application with integrated content management capabilities.

### Vision Statement

To create an engaging, educational digital experience that preserves and presents the rich heritage of Hungarian historical photography studios, making this cultural treasure accessible to both exhibition visitors and global online audiences while maintaining the highest standards of digital preservation and user experience.

### Problem Statement
