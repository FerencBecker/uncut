- How will the system handle concurrent users on the web platform during peak traffic?
- What image optimization strategy will balance quality with loading performance across different devices?
- How will the search and filtering functionality perform with 3,000+ images and growing content?

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- How will the shared components and data structures be maintained between kiosk and web versions?
- What testing strategy ensures consistent functionality across Raspberry Pi 5, older PCs, and various web browsers?
- How will the responsive design handle the extreme range from mobile screens to 55-inch displays?
- What fallback mechanisms are needed for older or less capable devices?

### Content Management & Updates
- How will the Excel-to-JSON import process handle data validation and error reporting?
- What workflow will ensure content quality and consistency during the ongoing addition of ~3,000 images?
- How will the CMS balance ease of use for museum staff with the need for structured, consistent data?
- What approval and publication workflow will prevent incomplete or incorrect content from going live?

## Project Scope Questions

### MVP Definition & Prioritization
- What constitutes the minimum viable kiosk version for the February 2026 exhibition opening?
- Which web platform features are essential for the July 2026 launch vs. future enhancements?
- How will the 21 highlighted studios be selected and prioritized from the total 70-80 available?
- What is the fallback plan if MuseumPlus integration proves more complex than anticipated?

### Technical Decision Points
- Should the CMS be built as a MuseumPlus extension or as a separate frontend system, and what are the trade-offs?
- What are the specific advantages and risks of Raspberry Pi 5 vs. traditional PC for the kiosk deployment?
- Should the map be a custom graphic provided by NM or an adapted open-source solution?
- How will the offline capability requirements affect the web version architecture and hosting strategy?

### Resource & Timeline Management
- What are the critical path dependencies between kiosk and web development that could impact delivery dates?
- What hardware testing and on-site installation requirements need to be scheduled before February 2026?
- How will the intensive support period (until July 12, 2026) be structured and resourced?
- What knowledge transfer is needed to enable NM staff to manage ongoing content updates?

### Risk Assessment & Mitigation
- What are the highest-risk technical components (MuseumPlus API, offline reliability, touch interface) and their mitigation strategies?
- How will the project handle potential changes in exhibition design or content requirements?
- What contingency plans exist for hardware failures or compatibility issues?
- How will the project ensure data security and backup for both cultural heritage content and visitor analytics?

### Quality Assurance & Validation
- What testing protocols will validate the sophisticated motion design and animation requirements?
- How will the bilingual content accuracy and cultural sensitivity be verified?
- What user acceptance testing approach will involve actual museum visitors and staff?
- How will the system handle edge cases like network interruptions, hardware malfunctions, or corrupted data?

## Usage Instructions

These prompts should be used during PRD generation to ensure comprehensive coverage of all product aspects. Each question should be addressed with specific, actionable answers that guide development decisions. Pay special attention to:

1. **Dual-platform coherence**: Ensure kiosk and web versions complement each other while serving distinct use cases
2. **Cultural heritage sensitivity**: Maintain appropriate respect for historical content and museum context  
3. **Technical robustness**: Address the critical reliability requirements for exhibition and public-facing applications
4. **Scalability planning**: Consider the long-term content growth and platform evolution needs
5. **Stakeholder alignment**: Balance museum staff operational needs with visitor experience goals

Priority should be given to questions that address the unique challenges of this project: offline reliability, cultural heritage presentation, multi-platform consistency, and the complex relationship between historical photo studios and their geographic/temporal context.
