# Phase Backlog Summary: uncut

## Current Status Assessment

After reviewing the project documentation and existing GitHub issues, **Phase 1: Kiosk Platform is already complete** with a comprehensive development backlog. All necessary technical infrastructure and user-facing features for the kiosk platform are covered by existing issues #31-40.

## Existing Phase 1 Backlog Analysis

### Technical Stories (6 issues)
- **Issue #31**: Setup .NET 8 BFF-Mini Backend Service (3 days)
- **Issue #32**: Setup React 18 TypeScript Frontend Application (4 days) 
- **Issue #33**: Create Hungary Map SVG with Studio Locations (2 days)
- **Issue #34**: Setup Docker Containerization for Multi-Architecture Deployment (3 days)
- **Issue #35**: Create Museum Content Data Import Pipeline (4 days)
- **Issue #36**: Setup Production Environment and Hardware Configuration (5 days)

### User-Facing Stories (4 issues)
- **Issue #37**: K01 - Screensaver Attraction Mode (4 days)
- **Issue #38**: K03 - Interactive Map Navigation (5 days)
- **Issue #39**: K04 - Studio Information Panel (4 days)
- **Issue #40**: K06 - Fullscreen Gallery Lightbox (5 days)

## Architecture Compliance Assessment

The existing backlog fully aligns with the architectural decisions:
- ✅ Uses .NET 8 ASP.NET Core backend with JSON filesystem storage
- ✅ Implements React 18 TypeScript frontend with component reusability
- ✅ Follows Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern with offline capability
- ✅ Supports multi-architecture Docker deployment (ARM64 + x64)
- ✅ Implements entity-level JSON storage (one studio = one file)
- ✅ Includes comprehensive testing strategy (Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright)

## Design System Compliance Assessment

The existing user stories properly integrate the design specifications:
- ✅ Implements dual theme system (light/dark) with localStorage persistence
- ✅ Follows kiosk page specifications (K01, K03, K04, K06)
- ✅ Supports 55-inch display scaling (1.25x typography multiplier)
- ✅ Uses museum color palette with gold accents and blue gradients
- ✅ Implements touch-optimized interface with 64px touch targets

## Effort Summary
- **Technical Work**: 21 developer days (6 stories)
- **User-Facing Features**: 18 developer days (4 stories) 
- **Average Story Size**: 3.9 developer days

## Total: 10 stories already created as GitHub issues (39 total developer days)

**Phase 1: Kiosk Platform backlog is complete and ready for development.**

## Recommendation

Since Phase 1 is complete, the next logical step would be to create the Phase 2: Web Platform backlog, which would include:
- Web BFF with MuseumPlus API integration
- Zoomable interactive map for web
- Search and filtering functionality
- Content Management System (CMS)
- Additional web-specific user stories (W01-W12 pages)

Would you like me to proceed with creating the Phase 2: Web Platform backlog?
